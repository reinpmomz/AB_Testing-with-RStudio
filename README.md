Assess the impact on attendance rates in public primary schools by providing free meal on school days

The government of Uganda rolled out a school feeding program in selected districts to provide primary school pupils with a free meal on school days with the hope of increasing attendance rates in public primary schools. Schools in each district were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. 
- `1 = Treatment`
- `0 = Control`

Attached alongside this file is a data file named: `School data.xlsx`

- Your task is to assess the impact of the programme on school attendance.

## Description of the dataset

The Excel workbook contains two worksheets; one with the data on attendance and the other contains the district names. Each row of data contains data for each school within the district.
